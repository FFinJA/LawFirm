Through reviewing local large law firm websites and considering our own thoughts, we believe the website style should convey a professional impression characterized by restrained use of graphics, and even video while maintaining rich content. The website's content should primarily showcase the firm's areas of expertise and lawyer lineup, consistently presenting a sense of professionalism and restraint to the visitors.

The homepage of the website primarily presents the law firm's name, mission statement, affiliated law firms, the history of the firm, and successful individuals who have worked at the firm. The footer section displays information about the firm and its branches, along with a subscription button. Overall, the website conveys a professional and historically rich impression.

The main content entries on the website are located in the top right corner under 'Our Expertise' and 'Our Team'. The former provides links to nine legal practice areas and up to 20+ sub-practice areas. This section may be somewhat lengthy on the website and could benefit from improvements.

Within 'Our Expertise,' there are links to nine primary legal practice areas, along with over 20 sub-practice areas. The organization consists of nine separate links, each accompanied by a dropdown menu showcasing all sub-practice areas within that field. Each sub-practice area features buttons under its title, linking to profiles of lawyers specializing in that particular sub-field located further down the webpage.

The 'Our Team' page primarily showcases all lawyers and partners of the law firm, listed alphabetically by name. This page also includes a recruitment module where individuals interested in joining can provide their information and submit directly.

The challenge lies in finding suitable content and images for publication within a short timeframe. While images can be generated using artificial intelligence models, preparing web content ready for publication requires more time.
